This is my fourth project for school in java development.
The course covered how to build a webbapplikation with a database and how to communicate with that database using JPA.
I did this project on my own and built an app for a car repair shop.

Strengths:
- Single page application
- Creates content dynamically

Possible improvements:
- More appealing layout
- Use bootstrap, cut down on the amount of js.
- Improve validation

Techniques: JavaSE, JPA, Spring, Hibernate, Derby 

Enjoy!
